									<h2><a href="#">Unilever Canteen Online Ordering system Setup</a></h2>
									<p>This was an outstanding project in which we were able to solve a problem that was causing the company to lose funds and also causing employee dissatisfaction. In this project, the organisation was facing challenge in terms of lack of canteen space which potentially leads to waste of employees' time during their break. By introducing an online ordering system for the canteen, onboarding all employees and payroll staff, we were able to significantly reduce the canteen waiting time by over 50%, cut down food waste, reduce canteen crowd and make the food ordering system easily assessible.</p>

									<p>This was a unique project because the resort had alot of customers coming in from various parts of the world such as the United States, Portugal, United Kingdom e.t.c.
										However, we discovered through thorough analysis and data visualization that they had high churning rate.
										The suggestions we gave, helped the resort reduce churning rate by 15%. This analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/rosa-rafael-Pe9IXUuC6QU-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This skincare brand is an online cosmetic company that sell different cosmetic and beauty products. They have requsted our services to create an online web portal where customers can
										place orders and access quality customer service experience. This is an expansion for the company as they have previously been operating only via their social media handles. 
										We first had to breakdown the current process so as to understand what the current order fulfilment process is before we can come up with recommendations on what the ideal state should be and then build the online portal to that effect.
										We took the agile approach, and suggested improvement flows to current process while we go ahead to build the web portal.</p>
